# Multi-Disease Prediction System

A web-based application that predicts whether a patient is likely to have Heart Disease, Diabetes, or Lung Cancer. All models were trained using data collected from Kaggle and developed with the XGBoost algorithm for best performance. Each model has achieved an accuracy of over 97%.

Patients are required to enter health-related details such as weight, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking history, shortness of breath, and several other symptoms. The system uses these inputs to provide a highly accurate prediction for each disease.

## Project Overview

This system is designed to:

- Predict multiple chronic diseases based on user health data.
- Use separate XGBoost models trained on cleaned datasets from Kaggle.
- Offer predictions via a Flask backend API.
- Provide a frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (ReactJS)
- Deliver additional guidance through an integrated chatbot.

## Features

- Predicts Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Lung Cancer with over 97% accuracy
- Form-based input collection for health parameters
- Real-time prediction using trained machine learning models
- Chatbot provides follow-up suggestions, remedies, and treatment opinions
- Simple and clean user interface
