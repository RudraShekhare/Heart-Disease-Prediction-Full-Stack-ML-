# Multi-Disease Prediction App (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Lung Cancer + Gemini Chatbot)
 Overview

This is a full-stack AI-powered health prediction system that predicts the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Lung Cancer based on user-provided health data.

The backend is powered by Flask and pre-trained XGBoost models, while the frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS. It also integrates a Gemini AI chatbot to provide lifestyle advice, remedies, and general health guidance.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Machine Learning + Modern Web Development can create an accessible tool that supports awareness and decision-making.
